For a more detailed description, see "Improvement proposal" in my Bachelor Thesis.
- Code clean up (SignalHandler, Config and derived field remaining)
- CSV output of plot data
- Enhance config settings (permanent custom derived fields would be nice, and a default plot mode)
- Add default to "Create Plot" after pressing "Restore from Param_Dict"
- While calculating global extrema, have a progress dialog and possibility to write out the extrema
- Region selection: Boolean and predefined regions
- Enhance the menu (Shortcuts for derived fields and ScriptWriting)
- ScriptWriter support even if no file is loaded?
- Profile time as y-axis
- Fractional phase/profile
- Grids for cylindrical data
- Plotting h5py-imported data

Bugs found to fix later:
- Figure gets printed to console in iPython
- Weird behaviour for grid/streamline annotation if the center is set to (0, 0)  --> Warning already issued
- Timestamp shouldn't be togglable (and turned off) if multiple profiles are selected  --> Warning already issued
[Fixed]: Setting min/max for profile plots does always revert to default
[Fixed]: Restore Plot settings doesn't work well with the slider
[More or less fixed]: When drawing a line on a slice plot, the whole plot gets bigger

Done:
- Figure in another window
- Min/Max Units
- Min/Max Dictionary
- Addition of Boundaries to Min/Max Dictionary
- Set Heigth for slice
- Reimplementation of signals and slots
- Min/Max for projection
- Divide by domain length for projection
- Skript export of plot -> Done for Line, Slice, Phase, Profile and Projection and subtypes
- Weight fields for Phase, Profile and Projection
- Comments for script can be turned on/off
- Reload from figure
- Time series
- Multiple 2D Profiles
- Logging inside the GUI to communicate with user
- Convenient Min/Max for x, y, z (through domain borders)
- Custom Derived fields for script writer
- Custom derived fields
- Time Series 'Plot all'-implementation with option to save as movie
- ScriptWriting possible just from settings
- Particle annotation possible
- Particle plot infrastructure
- time as x-axis: options which quantity for y-field is calculated (i.e. 'max', 'min', 'weighted_averag' etc)
- time as x-axis: added support for the stored values and different quantities
- Scriptwriter for particle plots
- Add possibility to open External Window without having to plot again
- Make better size policy for everything
- Fix zooming and link it to Matplotlib Navigation tool
- Change zooming and panning to setting width and center
- Implement a proper logger instead of printing everything
- Menu Bar and shortcuts
- Annotate timestamp possible for every plot type
- Line length is displayed for line plots
- Help for each plot type
- Custom Normal Vector
- Use threading to calculate plot data
- Implement progress bars for time series things
- Easier addition of derived fields
- Aspect ratio can be ignored for slice or projection plots
- Added a config file to store preferred settings (homedir, logging etc.)
- Make 'Calculate Extrema' available in time series mode even if they have already been calculated
- Global extrema for time series mode
- Force override for custom derived fields
- Write licensing stuff
- User is asked before quitting (optional, togglable in the config options)
